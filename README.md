# PomodoroApp

Hello there!

First of all thank you for your time. The goal of this project is to make a Java application that allows a user to register his tasks and measure his time spent doing
a certain task based on a version of the pomodoro technique.
I'm not really interested in including the short and long breaks a pomodoro usually has, atleast for now.

Alright, so from this project i intend to learn about JavaFX, incorporating Design patterns (Singleton, for instance) and as much as possible about OOP.
If you look at the code you'll see that i am probably overcomplicating a bunch of things, and please do tell if there are any simpler solutions.

A thing that i've noticed so far is that while working with JavaFX, it became harder for me to incorporate Interfaces and Abstract Classes, because i've been using
Static methods. I'm not sure if this is the best approach.

Once again, thank you for your time, i hope you can learn something from this (Even if it is how NOT to do something :D), and also help me learn along the process!
